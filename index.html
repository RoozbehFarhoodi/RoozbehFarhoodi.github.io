I am currently a postdoctoral fellow with Dr.Konrad P Kording in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).
Previously, I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from Sharif University of Technology where I was advised by Dr.Morteza Fotouhi.
My research aims to link the intricate geometrical of neurons (morphology) to their functions. On the spare time, 
I play piano (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/roozbehfarhoodi/">what I'm practicing now</a>) and 
read books (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50136496-roozbeh-farhoodi">what I'm reading now</a>).
