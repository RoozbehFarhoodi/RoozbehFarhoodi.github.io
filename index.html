I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Professor Konrad Kording.

On the spare time, I play piano ([what I'm practicing now](https://www.instagram.com/roozbehfarhoodi/)), read books ([what I'm reading now](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50136496-roozbeh-farhoodi)).
