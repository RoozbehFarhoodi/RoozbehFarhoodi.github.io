# Personal Homepage of Roozbeh

Hi there, thanks for visiting my homepage. I used [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) to make this page which is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme, perfect for building personal sites, blogs, and portfolios. As the name implies, styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you.

I do recommend to use it for your personal homepage, just simply fork the repo and costumize it for your end [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).
